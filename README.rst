PCC (or Python Clean Code)
==========================

PCC streamlines execution of `isort` and `black`. This tool is like a bash `alias` or executing 2 commands in your terminal.
This didn't stop me to create a new Python package (though not deployed on PyPI), this serves for me personally
to train and write documentation.

How to use PCC:

    python -m pcc

Test your code:

    python -m pcc --test
